# :computer: Desney Clone

The Disney+ Clone is a web application designed to mimic the user interface of Disney's popular streaming service. The application was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, pure JavaScript, ReactJS, and React-Redux. It features a scrolling effect that allows users to easily navigate through different sections of the app.

One of the key features of the application is the use of React-Carousel to display movie posters and other content. Users can also sign in using their Google account for a more personalized experience. The app has different sections for different types of movies, making it easy for users to find the content they want to watch.

The Disney+ Clone was created as a project to showcase the my skills in building modern web applications using the latest web technologies. By replicating the user interface of a popular streaming service, the app offers users a familiar and engaging experience. Additionally, the project serves as a learning opportunity for the developer to improve their skills in building web applications.

## Installation

### Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
